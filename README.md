 We present the mobile base massive multiplayer game SPB, it's based on player vs player shooter game where a number of players fight in to remain last alive, the player has an option to adopt solo mode or team of four, last team/person alive wins the match.

        Each match starts with the player launch on unknown planet/arena, all the player will launch without any gear, the player needs to loot the weapons in order to survive all loot box are distributed procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match. During the gameplay random region of the map is highlighted with different danger zones, on average each session of the game held for 30 min. At the completion of the game session, each player will receive a loot box as per the number of kills in the game.

        Every time map/planet shrinks from the random location overtime if any player caught outside the safe area taking damage incrementally, and eventually being eliminated from the session During the course of the match, random regions of the map are highlighted in red and bombed, posing a threat to players who remain in that area.

        Throughout the gameplay Player can interact with another player's team member' via message or via voice which is available in the game, this acts as a social
hub for the players to interact with each other virtually. We will be using the GGP Google Gameplay service and Game circle for progression sync.

Target Audience :        
       For SPB our target audience is e-sports players. E-sports gaming community refers to games that feature a team of players trying to eliminate another team within a virtual map or complete an objective. Most of the e-sports players are encouraged to interact with and conflict with one another organically, not simply because they were spawned into the world, and are expected to know the objective.
      
Goal :
Survive the session of the match in the game, last remain person/team wins the match.

Objectives : 
    Navigate through the Planets/Arena
    Defend yourself against other players
    Collect objects that can be used as weapons
    Collect other player loot and craft weapons
    Get health to keep alive
